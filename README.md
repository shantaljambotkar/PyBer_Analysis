## Results:

### Summary:

![Summary of the Analysis](Numbers.PNG)

    1. The ride shares are most common in Urban areas as people dont prefer to own cars probably because of less space. When compared to Urban area suburbs have lesser rides as people prefer to own cars.  And in the Rural are there even fewer car rides.
    2. The drivers too are more in the Urban cities when compared to the suburban and rural cities as more car rides are required in the urban city.
    3. The total faires too follow a pattern like the drivers count - most in the urban cities, then in the Suburban cities and least in the Rural cities.
    4. Average fare per ride and Average fare per driver are both more in the Rural area following in the suburban cities and the least in the urban cities.

## Recommendations to address disparities among the city types:

1. In March all the city types have the lowest fares, we could have some adevertisements or promotions so that the fares dont drop.
2. Drivers and rides are concentrated in the Urban cities - we need to have a drivers in the suburbs and rural area - may be because there are fewer drivers the rides are less.  We need to experiment to find out the need is more but the drivers a few in suburan and rural cities.
3.  Increase the drivers in the urban cities - to see if there is a need for more driveres which could bring more revenue.
